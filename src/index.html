                A <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_chain">polygonal chain</a> is a series of points
                connected by line segments.
                They are commonly used to represent cartographic features (e.g. coastlines, rivers, roads) in the
                context of GIS (Geospatial Information System),
                vectorization of digital images in applications like computer vision, or in any application that uses
                vector graphics.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is often infeasible to maintain the original complexity of a polygonal chain, either because of size
                and/or computational constraints.
                Algorithms to simplify polygonal chains are therefore needed to reduce the complexity of the original
                chain by reducing
                the number of points while minimizing the variance from the initial structure.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm">Ramer-Douglas-Peuker
                algorithm</a>
                is commonly used for this task.</p>
            <p>
                Also known as the iterative end-point fit algorithm, it works by
                recursively processing the line segment between endpoints, dividing the segment until all original
                points are
                with the error distance from the approximating segments. The expected running time of the algorithm is
                &Theta;(n log n),
                with a worst case of O(n<sup>2</sup>).
            </p>
            <p>
                While generally fast, the algorithm doesn't minimize the number of the segments in the approximation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here, we examine an algorithm introduced by <a href="#paper2">Iri and Imai</a> that addresses the
                problem of minimizing
                line segments. While the original method has a time complexity of O(n<sup>3</sup>), we will also present
                an extension
                to the algorithm given by Eu and Toussaint in their paper, <a href="#paper1">On Approximating Polygonal
                Curves in Two and Three Dimensions</a>
                that improves the time complexity to O(n<sup>2</sup>), perhaps making it a practical alternative to the
                Ramer-Douglas-Peuker
                algorithm for certain applications.
            </p>

                We will present salient concepts associated with the algorithm, as well as an

                The Iri-Imai Algorithm for minimizing the number of line segments in an approximation, given error
                &epsilon;,
                works by first constructing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG
                (Directed Acyclic Graph)</a>, <em>G</em>, that
                contains all possible edges between vertices in the input polygonal chain. (n<sup>2</sup> edges).
            </p>
            <p>
                The weight of each edge is set to the number of vertices from the original chain that would be skipped
                by following the edge.
            </p>
            <p>
                For each edge, the distance between the edge and each vertex it skips is compared with &epsilon;. If all
                of the skipped vertices are
                within distance &epsilon; of the edge, the edge is kept as a potential approximating edge. Otherwise,
                the edge is discarded.

            <p>
                On this reduced set of edges, find the maximum weight path between the start and end points. The path is
                the simplified version of
                the input chain. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n<sup>3</sup>).

            The "Parallel Strip" criterion
        </h3>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>
                Eu and Toussaint improve the time complexity of Iri and Imai's algorithm for the min-# problem by using
                the "Parallel Strip" criterion for &epsilon;.
                By using this relaxed definition for measuring error, the directed graph
                described in Iri and Imai's algorithm can be constructed in an asymptotically faster way.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of the parallel strip is to buffer the line containing a potential approximating edge by
                &epsilon;. If all of the points
                that would be approximated by the edge lie within the parallel strip, then the edge is kept. Toussaint's
                first paper utilizing
                the parallel strip used this concept in an algorithm that solves the min-# problem in O(n<sup>2</sup>
                log n) time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the current paper, the authors show that the same criterion is met by buffering the vertices
                (creating error discs) that would be skipped by
                an approximating edge. Using this new formulation, they find a new way to construct <em>G</em>,
                yielding an
                overall
                time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>) for the algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interacting with the visualization below, it becomes clear that the error disc and parallel strip criteria are equivalent in terms
                of determining distance between a vertex and a potential approximating edge. Note that as a disc touches
                the approximating
                segment, the parallel strip touches the vertex associated with that disc.

                Each 'double wedge' is defined by a vertex, V<sub>i</sub>, and the error disc of one of the following

                by finding the 2 lines that go through V<sub>i</sub> that are tangent to the error disc. The double
